# Introduction to Git and GitHub

**Git** is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. **GitHub** is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides tools for collaboration, such as pull requests, issue tracking, and project management.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Repository (Repo):** A directory or storage space where your project lives. It can be local to a folder on your computer or hosted on GitHub.
- **Commit:** A snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time.
- **Branch:** A parallel version of your repository where you can work on changes without affecting the main codebase.
- **Pull Request (PR):** A request to merge changes from one branch into another, typically from a feature branch into the main branch.
