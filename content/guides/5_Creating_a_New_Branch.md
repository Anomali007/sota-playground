# Creating a New Branch

Working on a separate branch for each feature or bug fix helps maintain a clean and organized workflow.

1. **Create a New Branch:**
   - Use the `git checkout -b` command followed by your branch name:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/new-feature
     ```
   - This creates and switches to a new branch named `feature/new-feature`.

2. **Verify Current Branch:**
   - Check which branch youâ€™re on:
     ```bash
     git branch
     ```
   - The current branch will be highlighted with an asterisk (*).
