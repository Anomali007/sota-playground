# Creating a Pull Request

Once your feature or bug fix is ready, you can create a pull request (PR) to merge your changes into the main branch.

1. **Navigate to Your Repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to `https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo`.

2. **Initiate a Pull Request:**
   - Click the “Compare & pull request” button that appears for your recently pushed branch.
   - Alternatively:
     - Click on the “Pull requests” tab.
     - Click “New pull request”.
     - Select your feature branch as the compare branch and main as the base branch.

3. **Fill in PR Details:**
   - **Title**: Provide a concise title summarizing your changes (e.g., “Add authentication feature”).
   - **Description**: Elaborate on what you’ve done, why, and any other relevant information.
   - **Reviewers**: Assign reviewers if your repository has multiple collaborators.

4. **Create the Pull Request:**
   - Click “Create pull request” to submit.
