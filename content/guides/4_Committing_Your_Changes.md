# Committing Your Changes

1. **Stage Your Changes:**
   - To stage all modified files:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - Alternatively, to stage specific files:
     ```bash
     git add path/to/file1 path/to/file2
     ```

2. **Commit Your Changes:**
   - Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Add feature X to improve Y"
     ```
   - Ensure your commit messages are clear and descriptive for better project tracking.
