# Making Changes Locally

1. **Navigate to the Repository Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Check Repository Status:**
   - To see the current status of your repository, run:
     ```bash
     git status
     ```
   - This shows which files have been modified, added, or deleted.

3. **Open Files in Your Code Editor:**
   - Use your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text) to make changes.
   - Example using Visual Studio Code:
     ```bash
     code .
     ```
   - This command opens the current directory in VS Code.
